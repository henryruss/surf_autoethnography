Walking along the soft sands of the Gold Coast is an idyllic experience offering spectacular ocean vistas, views of marine life, utopian cityscapes, and many pleasant cafes. Athletes that look like social media influencers jog and rep calisthenic exercises along the boardwalk, and women tan on the grass and sands. Adding to the beachy vibe are the surfers found in the ocean. To the untrained eye, they complete the picture of the Gold Coast; however, this could not be further from the truth. I have been fortunate enough to explore and play in the Gold Coast over the past three months, and my experiences have led me to conclude that Surfers claim a completely different identity than that of their fellow residents.

        <p>Just outside the glitzy coast, the landscape begins to turn industrial. The busy roads turn quiet, the shops more barebones. One of the most worn of these is Burleigh Boardmakers in Currumbin. From the outside, the building does not scream any invitations. Once inside, however, vibrant art lines the walls. The boards on display are both products and artwork. Out back the scene becomes even more rundown. Surf workshops that look like they violate all sorts of health and safety protocols, half-finished boards, and rusty metal fill the landscape. The high-end Burleigh Pavilion enjoyer would feel uncomfortable, even distressed in this environment. The average surfer would be in heaven. For me, this experience marks one-way surfers differ from the average gold coast resident. They don’t need flashy or fancy things, and the further removed from society, the better. Those who brave the barren exterior can begin to understand the identity that Gold Coast Surfers bring: the art is filled with emotion, and exists half in reality and half in a euphoric plane.</p>

        <p>On another field trip, I found myself sitting in front of the legendary Wayne Rabbit Bartholomew. As he talked, my eyes wandered first to the road, where Gold Coast Residents could be seen walking, ordering food, workout out, and enjoying the day. I then panned over to the beach, where various groups or individuals could be seen stretching out in the sands, enjoying the sun, and chatting or reading a book. Then I looked to the water, where I saw a lone surfer paddling out on a longboard. They looked completely oblivious to the rest of the world, and I knew there was nowhere else in the world they would rather be. The waves were not great, but there was only two other surfers out. While on the board, that surfer was completely removed from society. The unimportant happenings and gossip of the residents on shore meant nothing out there, and the surfer was free to enjoy the gold coasts ocean, the one place the tiffles of society can never reach.</p>

        <p>While class filed trips were great for exposure to the Gold Coast and Gold Coast surf culture, oftentimes the most authentic interpretations come from personal experiences. One night I was by Burleigh Beach getting ready to enjoy the sunset when I found a Lime Bike lying on its side. On a whim I decided to ride it down the boardwalk further than I have ever been. I was expecting a nice sunset ride, but I got so much more out of it. Initially, my eyes were firmly on the boardwalk, just trying to weave and avoid people. As I got further, the crowd thinned. On the beach various photoshoots were going on, from teen girls taking pictures of each other to families. I passed many barbecue gatherings: a group of friends that looked distinctly Spanish, playing Spanish music and kicking a soccer ball around; further down, Norwegians wearing linen and chatting happily; still further, a gathering of Australian families complete with adults, teens, and kids. In the middle of the Australian barbecue stood a young teenage surfer holding his board. Torn between hot food off the grill and the final waves before sunset, he seemed caught in dilemma that I believe was a lot deeper than simply dinner versus playing in the ocean. As I continued biking, the boardwalk turned to road, yet there were no cars. The sun finished setting and the lights in the houses came on. Silhouettes of families eating could be seen, and I was struck with a feeling that I was viewing a very intimate side of the Gold Coast, one that is not given to those who only spend time on Burleigh Beach.</p>

Alone, these experiences did not influence my view on the Gold Coast or Gold Coast surf culture all that much. However, together I believe they paint a strong picture of the identity of the Gold Coast and of Gold Coast surfers. The Gold Coast is filled with societal influence, from the larger than life personas to the glitzy shops and cafes found along the boardwalk. Surfers on the other hand want nothing to do with society. They hide their identities and histories behind worn down shopfronts and are at their happiest when out on the water, where the break of the ocean acts as a barrier between themselves and the crowds. This is not to say that the Gold Coast isn’t a pleasant place to live, though. Once outside of the hustle and bustle of Burleigh Beach I found myself looking with adoration at the quiet houses lining the beachy streets. The family barbecues showed a much more real look at life here, outside of the performative lens of social media. Gold Coast residents are family people who enjoy spending quality time with loved ones. Many complain about the traffic and overcrowding of the Gold Coast. However, the area is practically paradise, from the beautiful nature to the pristine beaches. It is no wonder so many people want to be here, and businesses have taken the opportunity to accommodate them. I want to focus in on the teen surfer caught between the barbecue and the waves. There was no wrong answer, and it would be extreme to say that choosing one would mean forgoing the other choice. However, the teen’s hesitation symbolizes the balancing act that surfers–¬ and perhaps many Gold Coast residents– face: the pull between the comforts of the Gold Coast economy and the call of inner peace on the waves.
